# Baker Expense Report Helper Application

Application for Baker College P-Card holders to reconcile expected expenses against actual expenses submitted through the Purchase Form.

## What This Does

This app helps match expected expenses with actual purchases by:
- Reading expense data from the spreadsheet storing Purchase Form responses
- Automatically matching expected expenses with actual transactions
- Showing you what matched, what's missing, and what's extra
- Allowing manual matching with drag-and-drop
- Generating affidavits for expenses that require them

## Getting Started

### For Non-Technical Users

#### Step 1: Install Required Software

You need two programs installed on your computer:

1. **Python 3.13 or higher**
   - Go to [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Click the yellow "Download Python" button
   - Run the installer
   - **IMPORTANT**: Windows users: check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during installation
   - Click "Install Now"

2. **Node.js 18 or higher**
   - Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
   - Download the LTS (Long Term Support) version
   - Run the installer and follow the prompts

#### Step 2: Get the Code

1. Download this project as a ZIP file (or have someone send it to you)
2. Extract the ZIP file to a location you'll remember (like your Desktop or Documents folder)

#### Step 3: Open Terminal/Command Prompt

**On Mac:**
- Press `Command + Space` to open Spotlight
- Type "Terminal" and press Enter

**On Windows:**
- Press `Windows + R`
- Type "cmd" and press Enter

#### Step 4: Navigate to the Project Folder

In the terminal, type `cd` followed by a space, then drag and drop the project folder into the terminal window. Press Enter.

For example, it might look like:
```bash
cd /Users/YourName/Desktop/expense-report-automation
```

#### Step 5: Install Dependencies

Copy and paste these commands one at a time into the terminal (press Enter after each):

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

Wait for it to finish, then:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
npm install
```

(The frontend and backend have different dependencies, so npm install must be run in both places.)
#### Step 6: Run the App

Type this command and press Enter:
```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see messages saying the servers are starting. When you see "Local: http://localhost:5173", the app is ready.

#### Step 7: Open the App

Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) and go to:
```
http://localhost:5173
```

The app should now be running!

#### Step 8: Stop the App

When you're done using the app:
- Go back to the terminal window
- Press `Ctrl+C` (Windows/Mac) to stop the servers
- You can close the terminal window

### For Technical Users

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

#### Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..
npm install

# Run dev servers
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

## How to Use

### Reconciling Expenses

1. **Select Cardholder Name**: Choose the person whose expenses you want to reconcile from the dropdown
2. **Pick Start Date**: Only transactions from this date forward will be included
3. **Paste Purchase Form Spreadsheet Link**: Link to the Google Sheets with actual purchase data
4. **Paste Expected Expenses**: Copy/paste the list of expected expenses (see format below)
5. **Click "Reconcile Expenses"**: The app processes and shows results

### Generating Affidavits (Without Reconciliation)

If you just need affidavits for all expected expenses without reconciling:

1. **Fill out all form fields** as above
2. **Click "Generate Affidavits"**: Opens a modal with all expected expenses
3. **Download individual affidavits**: Click the "Download" button next to each expense

This generates filled affidavit PDFs with the vendor, price, date, and cardholder signature.

### Expected Expenses Format

Paste expenses one per line, directly copied and pasted from Kristen's email:
```
11/1/25 - Trader Joe's - $25.25
11/3/25 - Target - $9.99
11/5/25 - $15.00 - Amazon
```

Both `MM/DD/YY - Vendor - $Price` and `MM/DD/YY - $Price - Vendor` work.

## Understanding Results

The app shows three sections after reconciliation:

### ✅ Matched Expenses
Expected expenses that were successfully matched with actual transactions.

- If a matched expense requires an affidavit, you'll see a **"Download Affidavit"** link
- Click the link to generate and download a filled affidavit PDF

### ⚠️ Missing Expected Expenses
Expected expenses that weren't found in the actual transactions. You can:
- **Drag and drop** an Extra Actual card to manually match it
- Click the **✕** button to remove a manual match

### ➕ Extra Actual Expenses
Actual transactions that don't match any expected expense. These appear as draggable cards with red borders that you can drag to gray placeholder boxes.

## Manual Matching (Drag-and-Drop)

1. Scroll to the **Missing Expected Expenses** section
2. Find the expense you want to match in the **Extra Actual Expenses** section below
3. **Drag** the red-bordered card to the gray placeholder box next to the missing expense
4. To undo: click the **✕** button on the paired card

## Configuration
```

### Adjusting Matching Rules

Currently, a "match" is considered either an exact price-match or prices within a dollar and
a close lexical match between the expected and actual Vendor. If you want to change these thresholds, edit `backend/api.py` to change how strict matching is:
```python
price_tolerance=1.00       # Max price difference (in dollars)
similarity_threshold=0.75  # Min vendor name similarity (0-1)
```

## Troubleshooting

**App won't start?**
- Make sure you ran `npm install` from both the root folder and the frontend folder
- Make sure you ran `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`
- Check that ports 8000 and 5173 aren't being used by other programs

**Can't access Google Sheets?**
- Verify the spreadsheet URL is correct
- Make sure the spreadsheet is publicly viewable (Share → Anyone with link can view)

**Changes not showing?**
- Refresh your browser
- Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the app, then run `npm run dev` again
